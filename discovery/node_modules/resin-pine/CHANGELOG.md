## v5.0.3 - 2017-04-03

- Peer depend on resin-token 4.0.0

## v5.0.1 - 2017-01-06

### Changed

- Internal refactoring to the tests

## v5.0.0 - 2017-01-05

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Resin-Request and Resin-Token are now required to be injected, rather than being created internally.
- Upgraded `pinejs-client` to 3.0.0, which adds support for dates.
- Isomorphic-fetch is no longer required, as `resin-request` now uses its own `fetch` implementation
- **Breaking**: Timeouts in requests now use the Bluebird implementation. This changes how errors are thrown slightly: a Promise.TimeoutError is now thrown instead of a raw Error, with the message "operation timed out" instead of "timeout".
